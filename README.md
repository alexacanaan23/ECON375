# ECON375 - Econometrics
This repository contains STATA code for my final project in my econometrics course. This project explored the statisical effect of the Great Recession on different races in the United States. Using the American Housing Survey from 2007 and 2009, I created a panel data set (the observations from both years come from the same individuals) and calculated the difference in housing values between 2007 and 2009. I then used this metric as a proxy of the monetary effect of the Great Recession on individuals. I ran OLS, fixed effects, and random effects regressions with race as my independent variable in order to determine if it was correlated with different housing value changes.
